# Care Notes Backend Service

A high-performance, multi-tenant FastAPI backend service for managing care notes with optimized analytics capabilities.

## Features

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Support for multiple healthcare facilities and organizations
- **Optimized Analytics**: High-performance daily care statistics with SQL aggregations
- **Async Database Operations**: Efficient batch operations and concurrent request handling
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in performance testing and benchmarking tools
- **RESTful API**: Clean, documented endpoints for care note management

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: FastAPI 0.104.1
- **Database**: SQLite with aiosqlite (PostgreSQL-ready)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async support
- **Python**: 3.12+ (optimized for performance)
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt`

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Test-backend
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`

### Database Setup

The application automatically:
- Creates the database schema on startup
- Populates 100,000 test care notes with realistic data
- Sets up optimized indexes for analytics queries

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/care-notes` - List care notes with pagination
- `POST /api/care-notes` - Create a new care note
- `GET /api/care-notes/{note_id}` - Get specific care note
- `PUT /api/care-notes/{note_id}` - Update care note
- `DELETE /api/care-notes/{note_id}` - Delete care note
- `GET /api/analytics/daily-stats` - Get daily care statistics (optimized)
- `GET /api/analytics/daily-stats/original` - Get daily stats (original implementation)
- `GET /api/performance-test` - Run performance comparison tests

### Performance Testing

Run the built-in performance test:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/performance-test
```

This will compare the original vs optimized analytics implementations and provide detailed metrics.

## Design Decisions

### Database Choice
- **SQLite for Development**: Chosen for simplicity and to avoid Python 3.13 compatibility issues
- **PostgreSQL Ready**: Code is structured to easily switch to PostgreSQL for production
- **Async Support**: All database operations use async/await for better concurrency

### Optimization Strategy
- **SQL Aggregations**: Moved from Python-based aggregations to database-level SQL aggregations
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk insertions for data population
- **Indexing**: Strategic database indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Connection Pooling**: Prepared for production-grade connection management

### Multi-tenancy Approach
- **Tenant Isolation**: All queries filter by `tenant_id` for data security
- **Facility-level Filtering**: Support for filtering by multiple facilities within a tenant
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle thousands of tenants and facilities

### API Design
- **RESTful Principles**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Pagination**: Built-in pagination for large result sets
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with meaningful messages
- **Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response validation

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Level
- **Composite Indexes**: `(tenant_id, facility_id, created_at)` for efficient filtering
- **Date Range Indexes**: Optimized for time-based queries
- **Aggregation Queries**: Single SQL queries instead of multiple round trips

### Application Level
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking I/O for better concurrency
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient bulk operations for data setup
- **Connection Reuse**: Prepared statements and connection pooling ready

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless Design**: Application can be scaled horizontally
- **Database Sharding**: Architecture supports tenant-based sharding

### Vertical Scaling
- **Connection Pooling**: Configurable database connection pools
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient data structures and query optimization
- **CPU Utilization**: Async operations for better CPU utilization

### Production Readiness
- **Health Checks**: Built-in endpoint for monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Metrics**: Performance monitoring and alerting ready

## Future Improvements

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. **PostgreSQL Migration**: Switch to PostgreSQL for better performance
2. **Redis Caching**: Implement Redis for query result caching
3. **API Documentation**: Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
4. **Authentication**: Implement JWT-based authentication
5. **Rate Limiting**: Add request rate limiting

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
1. **Microservices**: Split into separate services (analytics, notes, users)
2. **Message Queue**: Implement async task processing with Celery
3. **Monitoring**: Add Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline

### Long Term (3-6 months)
1. **Data Warehouse**: Implement data warehouse for advanced analytics
2. **Machine Learning**: Add ML-powered insights and predictions
3. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket support for real-time updates
4. **Mobile API**: Optimized endpoints for mobile applications
5. **Internationalization**: Multi-language support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.12+ is installed
2. **Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if packages are missing
3. **Database**: Delete `care_notes.db` to reset the database
4. **Port Conflicts**: Change port in `main.py` if 8000 is occupied

### Performance Issues

1. **Slow Queries**: Check database indexes are created
2. **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks in long-running processes
3. **Concurrency**: Ensure async operations are properly awaited
